## Overview

Have you ever created files named "`01_clean.R`", "`02_analysis.R`", and "`03_plots.R`" and forgotten to run one of the files in the right order? Have you had to manually rerun an entire analysis after a single input changes—even if that input only affected one plot? Data analysis involves many moving parts. Traditional script-based approaches often lead to fragile pipelines, wasted computation, and reproducibility nightmares. Fortunately, the [{targets} package](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/) for R offers a powerful solution by implementing a Make-like pipeline toolkit that transforms chaotic scripts into streamlined, automated workflows that intelligently skip unnecessary steps.


## Materials

All the materials we'll use today are three self-contained RStudio projects:

[{{< fa file-zipper >}}&ensp;targets-penguins.zip](materials/targets-penguins.zip){.btn .btn-success target="_blank"} &ensp; [{{< fa file-zipper >}}&ensp;08-comparisons-original.zip](materials/08-comparisons-original.zip){.btn .btn-success target="_blank"} &ensp; [{{< fa file-zipper >}}&ensp;08-comparisons-targets.zip](materials/08-comparisons-targets.zip){.btn .btn-success target="_blank"}

## Packages

You'll need all these packages on your computer if you're following along:

```r
install.packages(
  c("tidyverse", "ggrepel", "sf", "tigris", "dataverse", "jsonlite", 
    "targets", "tarchetypes", "tidybayes", "brms",
    "marginaleffects", "modelsummary", "parameters", "patchwork"
  )
)
```
