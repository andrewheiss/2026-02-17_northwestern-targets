Have you had to manually rerun an entire analysis after a single input changes—even if that input only affected one plot? Data analysis involves many moving parts. Traditional script-based approaches often lead to fragile pipelines, wasted computation, and reproducibility nightmares. Fortunately, the {targets} package for R offers a powerful solution by implementing a Make-like pipeline toolkit that transforms chaotic scripts into streamlined, automated workflows that intelligently skip unnecessary steps."
